# ðŸŽ¶ VibeVault

**VibeVault** is a full-stack web application for streaming music and browsing movies.  
It showcases integration of **React.js**, **Django REST Framework**, and public APIs like **TMDB** and **Last.fm**.  
This project was built for hands-on learning of frontend and backend workflows using custom and third-party APIs.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, TailwindCSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework (custom music API)
- **APIs Used**:
  - ðŸŽ¬ TMDB (The Movie Database) API â€“ For movies
  - ðŸŽµ Last.fm API â€“ For music
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Postman, VS Code

## ðŸ§  Project Insight & Learning Purpose

This project was developed as part of my full-stack learning journey, focusing on **practical integration of public APIs** through both frontend and backend workflows.

### ðŸŽ¬ Movie Section â€“ TMDB API (Frontend Integration)
- For the movie section, I used the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API**.
- The data was **directly fetched in the frontend using React**, demonstrating how a frontend developer might work with public APIs.
- Since TMDB restricts some content access, the data may require **VPN access** to preview.
- This helped me understand **frontend API consumption**, state management, and component rendering using live data.

### ðŸŽµ Music Section â€“ Last.fm API (Backend + Custom API)
- For music streaming, I used the **Last.fm API** as a base and integrated it through the **Django backend**.
- I created a **custom API endpoint** that connects to Last.fm, enriches the data with video clips, and serves it to the frontend.
- The React frontend then consumes this custom API â€” simulating how a **full-stack developer** might abstract and control external API behavior.
- This allowed me to explore **Django REST Framework**, API creation, and backend/frontend integration.

> ðŸ’¡ The goal was to explore **both frontend-only and full-stack** implementations for API-driven features.  
> It reflects a real-world scenario: *"What if Iâ€™m just a frontend dev fetching public APIs? And what if Iâ€™m building a full-stack app with a custom backend?"*
